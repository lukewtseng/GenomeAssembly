Final project for Berkeley CS267 parallel computing.

1) Build binary:
	make

2) 2 ways of execution
	a. run with any {filename}.txt file within hw3-datasets/
		make DATA={filename}.txt run 
	b. run with any {filename}.txt file within hw3-datasets/smaller/
		make DATA={filename}.txt} runsmall

3) Test the correction
	a. if run with {filename}.txt within hw3-datasets/
		make DATA={filename}.txt check
	b. if run with {filename}.txt within hw3-datasets/smaller
		make DATA={filename}.txt checksmall
